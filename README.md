Dude, just finished watching The Ugly Stepsister, and I'm like, what even was that movie? ðŸ˜‚ It's like they took Cinderella, flipped it on its head, then shook it really hard. Okay, not a total mess, some parts were def funny, but I'm not sure if it meant to be funny, you get me?

You know when you're just sitting there, and you start questioning your life choices? Yeah, happened to me halfway through. I was really tempted to download the movie instead of paying for it. Glad I didn't though, my internet is already slow AF, haha. Seriously, some of the scenes were like too on the nose, yâ€™know? But kinda charming in their own messed-up way.

There's this one part where they try to make the stepsister all deep and whatnot, and I'm sitting there like, Okay, but why tho? I guess they just really wanted you to feel sorry for her, but jokes on them, I was too busy laughing at the goofy outfits. ðŸ™ˆ And omg, the acting? Some were decent, others... let's just say I wouldn't watch the movie again because of them.

> I can't figure out if the director was a genius or just super confused. I mean, talk about mood swings. One moment you're all aww and the next you're like WTF?! in the best possible way, though. Like a really weird emotional rollercoaster. Somehow, I think the awkwardness was the point? Or at least thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m telling myself to make sense of it all.

Random thought: the soundtrack actually slapped. ðŸŽ¶ Pretty sure itâ€™s gonna stick with me more than the story itself. Who even picks these tracks? Kudos to whoever did, they deserve a medal or something.

Anyway, might need to clear my mind with some classic Disney now or some other throwback. Oh, before I forget, my bad sense of humor almost made me go back and watch the movie again, like what the hell is wrong with me? ðŸ˜‚ It wasn't all bad, kinda like a love-hate thing going on. Artistic chaos or just chaos, who knows.

for i in range(3): print(Why am I even typing this?)

Okay, so that's my rant LOL. Have you seen it? If not, consider yourself warned but also kinda curious, right? Maybe watch it together sometime, dude. You'll get a kick out of it for sure. Let me know what you think if you do!
